# learning-go

Documenting my journey of learning Go. Includes notes, examples, and small practice programs inspired by resources like Go by Example and other tutorials.

## Contents

- `cmd/playground/main.go`: small runnable playground/example entrypoint.
- `topics/`: collection of short example files and notes (e.g. `array.go`, `map.go`, `pointer.go`, `slice.go`, `struct.go`).

## Quick start


Run the playground example:

```bat
go run ./cmd/playground
```

## Notes

- This repo is intended as a personal learning journal rather than a production library. Use it for reference and experimentation.
